# DevOps Workflow Automation for an Open-Source Project on a Cloud Platform

Project Description:
Implement a robust DevOps workflow automation for an existing open-source application using a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure. 
##  Key Features:
  1.	Select an Open-Source Project: Choose an open-source project that interests you. The project can be selected from GitHub repositories or any other platform. Ensure it has sufficient complexity (multiple services, database requirement, etc.), and you understand its architecture and deployment needs.
  2.	Dockerize the Application: Learn about the application's deployment steps and convert them into Dockerfile(s). This will make the application easier to deploy and scale.
  3.	Kubernetes Deployment: Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files for each Dockerized service. Deploy your application on a Kubernetes cluster.
  4.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilize Terraform to define and provision the cloud infrastructure needed for the application.
  5.	CI/CD Pipeline: Utilize a CI/CD platform like Jenkins or GitLab CI to set up pipelines for build, test, and deployment processes.
  6.	Cloud Services: Use the relevant cloud services like managed databases, storage systems, load balancers, etc.
  7.	Monitoring and Logging: Implement application monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, and centralized logging using the ELK stack or a cloud provider's logging service.
  8.	Security: Implement proper security measures including managing secrets with Vault, setting up IAM roles and policies, network policies, etc.
## Areas of Expertise You'll Gain:
  1.	Docker & Containerization
  2.	Kubernetes & Container Orchestration
  3.	Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
  4.	CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins or alternatives)
  5.	Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  6.	Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
  7.	Security (IAM, Vault)
This project will help you gain hands-on experience in DevOps, including CI/CD, containerization, orchestration, cloud services, and IaC, without requiring application development skills.
